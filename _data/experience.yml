    Project manager as casting director at Actors Agency Lithuania: In this role, I managed the casting process for various commercial and film projects, working closely with directors and production teams to identify and select the best candidates for each role. I also oversaw the day-to-day operations of the agency, including managing client relationships, coordinating talent schedules, and negotiating contracts.

As an assistant project manager in the same Actors Agency Lithuania, I provided support on multiple projects simultaneously, helping to ensure that each project was completed on time, within budget, and to the satisfaction of stakeholders. I assisted with project planning, resource allocation, risk management, and quality control.
