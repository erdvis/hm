  My passion for cycling has led me to build my own bikes, both for MTB and road cycling. There's something special about building a bike from scratch and then taking it out for a spin, feeling the wind in my face and the freedom of the open road. It's a perfect way to clear my head and get some exercise at the same time. I enjoy both road and off-road cycling, and have competed in a few local events in the past.

 In addition to cycling, I enjoy photography as a way to capture memories and tell stories through images. I'm always learning new techniques and experimenting with different styles to create something truly unique.

 Music production is another hobby that allows me to explore my creative side. I'm currently working on my first album, which is an exciting journey of experimentation and self-expression. There's something magical about creating a piece of music from scratch and watching it come to life. It's a challenging process, but one that's deeply rewarding.
